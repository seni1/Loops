Create the variable offset with an initial value of 8.
Code a while loop that keeps running as long as offset is not equal to 0. Inside the while loop:
Print out the sentence "correcting...".
Next, decrease the value of offset by 1. You can do this with offset = offset - 1.
Finally, still within your loop, print out offset so you can see how it changes.






------------------------

Inside the while loop, complete the if-else statement:
If offset is greater than zero, you should decrease offset by 1.
Else, you should increase offset by 1.
If you've coded things correctly, hitting Submit Answer should work this time.
If your code is still taking too long to run (or your session is expiring), you probably made a mistake. 
Check your code and make sure that the statement offset != 0 will eventually evaluate to FALSE!

# Initialize offset
offset = -6

# Code the while loop
while offset != 0 :
    print("correcting...")
    if offset > 0:
        offset = offset - 1
    elif offset < 0:
        offset = offset + 1
    print(offset)
